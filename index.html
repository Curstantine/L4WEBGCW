            <h2>Clean water and<br />sanitization is the way!</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    We believe clean water and sanitization is the best investment the world could make.
                    Yet, 2.2 billion people live with neither of them causing diseases and often times their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water,
                    lack of sanitation is undermining these advances.
                    If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices,
                    we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life.

                    By prioritizing sustainable water management practices and promoting hygiene education,
                    we aim to safeguard public health, preserve ecosystems,
                    and foster resilience against water-related challenges.
