                        Today, 785 million people still lack access to clean water. That is 1 in 10
                        people on the planet. By 2025, half of the world is population will be
                        living in water-stressed areas. We are familiar with water cuts – but how
                        would we feel if we didn’t have clean water at all? Yet that is a reality
                        for far too many.

                        What started with one charity partner in 2008, has become 140 partners. Our

                        the stark need. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are still
                        without clean water. This work feeds our hearts and souls.

                        world who live without it — a situation that affects not only health, but
                        education and income.

                        Clean water has the ability to change lives! It’s the foundation for all
                        other levels of development. Safe water can ultimately transform the health,
                        safety, education, and livelihoods of entire communities. Now, that’s making
                        an impact.

                        The drinking-water guidelines are supported by background publications that
                        provide the technical basis for the Guidelines recommendations. WHO also
                        supports countries to implement the drinking-water quality guidelines
                        through the development of practical guidance materials and provision of
                        direct country support. This includes the development of locally relevant
                        drinking-water quality regulations aligned to the principles in the
                        Guidelines, the development, implementation and auditing of water safety

                        Water is essential to life, yet by 2040 almost three billion people will
                        face water scarcity. Stainless steel plays a key role in almost every
                        element of delivering safe, clean drinking water. From its use in
                        desalination plants, to service pipework and wastewater treatment plants,
                        stainless steel offers a long-lasting, sustainable solution ensuring an
                        infrastructure that provides clean water while minimizing water loss. It is
                        the ideal material because it is:

                        In 2021, over 2 billion people live in water-stressed countries, which is
                        expected to be exacerbated in some regions as result of climate change and
                        population growth

                        In 2022, globally, at least 1.7 billion people use a drinking water source
                        contaminated with faeces. Microbial contamination of drinking-water as a
                        result of contamination with faeces poses the greatest risk to
                        drinking-water safety.

                        One in three people live without sanitation. This is causing unnecessary
                        disease and death. Although huge strides have been made with access to clean
                        drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. If we
                        provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop
                        this senseless suffering and loss of life.

                        Safe and sufficient water facilitates the practice of hygiene, which is a
                        key measure to prevent not only diarrhoeal diseases, but acute respiratory
                        infections and numerous neglected tropical diseases

                        purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of
                        water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute
                        greatly to poverty reduction
