        <h2>Clean water and<br/>sanitization is the way!</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                We believe clean water and sanitization is the best investment the world could make.
                Yet, 2.2 billion people live with neither of them causing diseases and often times their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water,
                lack of sanitation is undermining these advances.
                If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices,
                we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We hold the conviction that water serves as a crucial catalyst in breaking the chains of poverty,
                safeguarding lives, and nurturing hopeful futures.
                Our mission is centered on democratizing access to water and sanitation, striving to ensure its safety,
                availability, and affordability for all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aligned with this ethos, we have embraced the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
                framework.
